# [Image to ColourPop](https://willowis.cool/img2cpop)

A website that converts an image to a colourpop palette.

`getcolor.js` contains the code to scrape the site to get the shade info, and add color info to it. The site-scraping part is definitely not perfect but it does the job well enough. In order to run it, `npm install` and then `node getcolor.js`. The results, as of June 25th, 2022, are in `shadesWithColor.json`.
